                  <h1>PLOT</h1>
                      Two years after Thaddeus Sivana's defeat,[a] Hespera and Kalypso, two of the daughters of the Titan Atlas, break into the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece to steal the Wizard's broken staff.[b] They take it to the Wizard, imprisoned in the Gods' Realm, and force him to repair the staff and reactivate its powers.    
                      In Philadelphia, Billy Batson and his "Shazamily" of foster siblings save people on the collapsing Benjamin Franklin Bridge, but are called out for its destruction. The group is drifting apart at home as they grow up and have their own personal interests, in particular the eldest girl, Mary, who resents that her secret life as a superhero has prevented her from going to college. Billy is worried about being kicked out of the Vasquez family when he "ages out" of the foster system. In a dream, the Wizard warns Billy about the Daughters, prompting the Shazamily to begin researching them.    
                      Freddy Freeman, still bullied at school, falls for a new girl named Anne, to whom he shows off his superhero self. Hespera and Kalypso arrive with the staff and steal Freddy's powers, and Anne is revealed to be their youngest sister, Anthea. Billy and the Shazamily attempt to save Freddy, but the daughters kidnap him and place an indestructible dome around the city, trapping everyone inside. Freddy is imprisoned with the Wizard in the Gods' Realm. The Daughters reveal that they want revenge because the Wizard killed their father.
                      Meanwhile, the Shazamily enter the Rock of Eternity, where they encounter a sentient pen named Steve, which they use to draft a letter to Hespera as a negotiation for Freddy's release. Billy meets Hespera at a local restaurant, and, while the meeting is initially cordial, she and Kalypso soon fight the Shazamily. Pedro loses his powers during the fight, while Hespera is captured and taken to the Rock. Hespera easily breaks out and steals the Golden Apple, the seed of the Tree of Life. Meanwhile, Freddy and the Wizard attempt to escape the Gods' Realm with a sympathetic Anthea's help, just as Hespera returns with the Apple. The Daughters argue as Hespera and Anthea want to use the Apple to revive their realm, while Kalypso wishes to plant it on Earth to destroy it. Freddy steals the Apple but is discovered. Billy and the Shazamily show up, and Freddy reacquires his powers.    
                      Billy and the Shazamily emerge with the Wizard in the Vasquez home, where they reveal their secret identities to their foster parents. Kalypso appears with a dragon named Ladon to acquire the Apple. All but Billy lose their powers in the skirmish, while Kalypso retrieves the Apple and uses it to plant the Tree at Citizens Bank Park, which spawns various monsters, including Cyclopes, Harpies, Manticores, and Minotaurs, to attack the city. Hespera and Anthea object to their sister's destructive plan, but Kalypso mortally wounds Hespera and de-powers Anthea. Billy, in despair, asks the Wizard to revoke his powers, but the Wizard assures him he is a true hero who is worthy of them.    
                      Heeding the Wizard's words, Billy flies off to stop Kalypso, while the Shazamily enlists the help of unicorns to fend off the other monsters. Billy persuades a dying Hespera to help him stop Kalypso. Realizing the dome reacts violently to his lightning, Billy lures Kalypso to the Park while Hespera shrinks the dome to contain them. Billy fights Kalypso and Ladon before killing them both by overloading the staff with electricity, destroying the Tree and Kalypso's army with them, at the cost of his own life. Hespera acknowledges Billy as a true god before succumbing to her wounds.
                      Anthea takes Billy's grieving family to the Gods' Realm for his burial. Diana Prince, the last living being with godly powers, appears and repairs the staff, imbuing it with her power and using it to revive the Gods' Realm, restore Anthea's powers, and resurrect Billy. Billy in turn uses the staff to restore his siblings' powers. The Shazamily rebuild their home while Anthea and the Wizard take up residence on Earth.   
                      In a mid-credits scene, Emilia Harcourt and John Economos attempt to recruit Billy into the Justice Society on behalf of Amanda Waller. In a post-credits scene, a still-incarcerated Sivana encounters Mister Mind once again, infuriated that he has not begun enacting their plan.
